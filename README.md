## Overview
 This is my password generator! 

 Here is a link to the deployed webpage: [https://cachamoe.github.io/Password-Generator/]

I completed this assignment given the acceptance criteria: 


```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Website Features
1) Check boxes that allow for the user to select which criteria they want to use for the password
2) Once the generate password button is clicked, a prompt arises that asks the user for how long they want the password to be
3) Password length ranges from 8 to 128 characters
